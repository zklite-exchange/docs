If you want to use [**zkLite Exchange**](https://zklite.io) on zkSync, you will first need to bridge your funds from Ethereum Layer 1 to zkSync Layer 2. After that, a [one-time activation fee ](https://docs.lite.zksync.io/userdocs/faq/#what-is-the-account-activation-fee)is required by zkSync's design to activate your account. You're then ready to start trading on [zkLite.io](https://zklite.io)

1. Go to [https://lite.zksync.io/](https://lite.zksync.io/), switch your wallet network to Ethereum, connect your wallet, and sign the message to access your account
2. Go to [Top up -> Bridge](https://lite.zksync.io/transaction/deposit) and fill in the amount and the token you want to transfer from L1 to L2.
   * Alternatively, you can also top-up/deposit via Bybit, LayerSwap, ..v.v
3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait until your funds are bridged to zkSync
4. Once your funds have arrived, sign zkSync's one-time activation fee and start trading at [https://trade.zklite.io/](https://trade.zklite.io/)
