# Market-maker bot

Instead of traditionally LP'ing funds into a liquidity pool, on **zkLite Exchange**'s order book users can run a market maker bot. This means users are stepping into DeFi and getting yield on their funds without impermanent loss. Market making provides liquidity for **zkLite Exchange** while earning a profit from the spread. Make sure to rebalance when needed!

Anyone can run a market maker bot on zkSync Lite. The market maker bot fills the market and limit orders. Technical instructions on how to run the bot can be found in the [README in the market-maker repository](https://github.com/zklite-exchange/market-maker) on GitHub. The code can be found on [this specific GitHub page](https://github.com/zklite-exchange/market-maker).\
