[**zkLite exchange**](https://zklite.io) is a fork of [ZigZag](https://zigzag.exchange), thanks to its open-source codes.

The platform is a decentralized order book exchange built on ZK Rollups.\


{% hint style="info" %}
Unfortunately, ZigZag is discontinued due to the pressure from US regulators. \
zkLite Exchange will continue this mission to provide order-book trading experience on zkSync Lite and so on.
